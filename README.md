# ab

This is a proof of concept implementation of a tool which builds container
images using Ansible playbooks. It has a pluggable builder selection â€” it is up
to you to pick the tool which will be used to construct your container image.
ab relies on [Ansible connection
plugins](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.6/plugins/connection.html) for
that. You may be asking: why not
[ansible-container](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container)? This tool is
actually heavily inspired by ansible-container: the main distinction is that
ansible-container covers the complete lifecycle of a containerized application
while ab takes care of image builds only.

**Please note that this project is not affiliated with Ansible project. It's just using Ansible to do something magical.**
